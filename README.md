# Snake Game üêç

## Overview
This is a simple **console-based Snake Game** made in C++ using basic programming concepts.  
I developed this as my **1st semester BS CS project**, so it is intentionally simple and may still have some imperfections.  
The main focus was to apply what I had learned at the time ‚Äî loops, functions, arrays, and basic game logic.

## Features
- Border created using `*`
- Snake represented with `--`
- Food represented with `o`
- Score increases when snake eats the food
- Simple game loop using `while`
- Basic collision detection with walls and snake body

---

## Controls
- **W** ‚Üí Move Up  
- **S** ‚Üí Move Down  
- **A** ‚Üí Move Left  
- **D** ‚Üí Move Right  
- **X** ‚Üí Exit game

---

## Known Imperfections
Since this was my first project:
- No advanced features like pause, speed increase, or high score save.
- Uses `system("CLS")` and `system("pause")` which are not efficient for real game development.

---

## How to Run
1. Open the `.cpp` file in **Visual Studio** (or any C++ compiler).
2. Compile and run the code.
3. Enjoy the game in the console.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this project was **learning**, not perfection.  
It helped me understand:
- Game loops
- Handling user input
- Using arrays for storing positions
- Simple collision detection
